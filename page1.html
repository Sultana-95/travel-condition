		<h3> Condition During Travel</h3>
		<br><br>
		<h2 class="text-justify"> Why a lot of changes may occur on our bodies at air travel?</h2>
		<br>
		
<ul class="text-justify">
<li class="text-justify">Atmospheric pressure.</li>
<li class="text-justify">Drought.</li>
<li class="text-justify">Sit for long time.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2 class="text-justify">The health problems:</h2>
<br>
<li class="text-justify">Constipation </li>
Travel constipation, or vacation constipation, happens when suddenly find yourself unable to poop according to your regular schedule, whether it’s for a day or two or longer.

Constipation can occur for a number of reasons, from a sudden change in your diet or exercise to bodily changes from certain health conditions. It’s worth thinking about these possibilities when you suddenly can’t go number two.

But travel constipation is common after a long flight for pretty much all of these reasons. When you travel, your diet is usually interrupted, and sitting down for hours at a time can slow things down in your gut.

Annually more than 4 billion people take scheduled airplane flights. And that’s not even including all the travelers on road trips and train rides.

So you’re far from alone in having experienced this side effect of traveling. But there’s plenty you can do to treat it after it happens and prevent it from ever occurring in the first place.
Here are some home remedies for constipation that you can try while you’re on the road or after you get home from a trip and still aren’t regular:
<br>
Drink water<br>
Make sure you’re drinking at least half your body weight in ounces of fluid or more each day. Travel with a reusable water bottle and find refill stations at airports or train stations.
<br>
Eat fiber<br>
Bring along travel snacks or meals rich in fiber so that you can get the recommended 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day. Try dried fruits and vegetables that are low in added sugars, or fiber bars and trail mix.

But remember you must drink enough fluids for the fiber to have a positive effect. If you just eat more fiber and don’t supplement with additional fluids, you could end up more constipated and gassy.
<br>
Pack fiber supplements<br>
Fiber supplements — like psyllium (Metamucil) and calcium polycarbophil (FiberCon) — can help poop move through your intestines.
<br>
Try stool softeners<br>
Use a stool softener before you head out on a long flight or trip. This can help you poop more often or more easily by making stool softer and easier to pass with natural intestinal moisture. Try an over-the-counter stool softener like docusate sodium (Colace).
<br>
Consider osmotics<br>
Bring along an osmotic to help your colon produce more fluid. This includes over-the-counter (OTC) osmotics like magnesium hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia) and polyethylene glycol (Miralax).
</p>  
<li class="text-justify">Drought</li>
<p class="text-justify">Aircraft cabins have low humidity levels( dehydration in the atmosphere, dry skin and mouth and  sinus).
Airplane cabins have very low humidity levels, Dr. Goldman explains, because about 50 percent of the air circulating in the cabin is pulled from the outside, and at high altitudes the air is almost completely devoid of moisture. This might cause your throat, nose and skin to feel dry.
What you can do: To stay hydrated, pack an empty water bottle in your carry-on that you can refill after going through security and take with you on the plane,. That way you don’t have to rely on those tiny drinks from the beverage cart to get you through a multiple-hours flight. Wear glasses instead of contacts to help prevent discomfort to the eyes. Pack small bottles of lotion, eye drop or nasal spray if you’re
 worried about drying out.</p>
<li class="text-justify">Impaired hearing and taste</li>
<p class="text-justify">The dryness of  air on the plane causes the dryness of the sinuses, which are connected to the taste buds, affecting the taste of food. Atmospheric pressure + high engine sounds = hearing impairment.
It is common to experience a 'popping' sensation in your ears during take-off and landing. This is caused by the air pressure changes that occur during a flight mean that during take-off air moves out of your middle ear and sinuses and during landing it flows back into your sinuses and middle ears.
 If you experience any discomfort, simple measures usually relieve symptoms such as:
 <ol class="text-justify">
<li class="text-justify">swallowing</li>
<li class="text-justify">chewing</li>
<li class="text-justify">yawning</li>
<li class="text-justify">using a pacifier (dummy) in infants (as it mimics swallowing)</li>
</ol>
<p class="text-justify">If you are suffering from an ear or sinus infection you may experience intense pain during take-off and landing.

You should discuss this with a doctor prior to flying as it may potentially cause an injury within your ear.</p>
<li class="text-justify">Swelling</li>
<p class="text-justify">The cramped conditions and long periods of being less active on a flight can cause pain, 
stiffness or swelling of your legs. Being less active can lead to slow blood flow in your veins which increases your 
risk of developing a blood clot, known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVTs most commonly form in the legs. Part of the 
clot may break off and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism
 (PE) which is potentially life threatening. </p>
<li class="text-justify">Headache</li>
<p class="text-justify">There are enough metaphoric "headaches" when flying: missed connections, delays, long security lines. So the last thing you need is an actual airplane headache—a.k.a. "aviation headache"—which can be caused by the change in altitude as a plane ascends and descends, says Tesha Monteith, M.D., assistant professor of neurology at the University of Miami.

Why does this happen? Known as aerosinusitis, the inflammation in the paranasal sinus cavities (those are the air-filled spaces that stem from the sides of your nose to between your eyebrows) is caused by a difference in air pressures inside and outside the body. And that difference in pressure may cause blood vessels in the body to dilate, which can lead to head pain. Migraines can also be triggered during air travel due to a variety of factors, including stress, dehydration, dry recirculated air, strong odors, and weather changes.

So how can you avoid a throbbing head on your next flight? Follow these steps:
<br>
<li class="text-justify">SKIP TRIGGERING FOODS</li><br>
Within 12-24 hours of your flight, pass on the red wine, aged cheeses, chocolate, and processed meats, all of which contain tyramine, a chemical compound that can signal pain pathways for those with a predisposition to headaches and migraines, says Dr. Monteith. Instead, try sticking to a natural plant-based diet just before and while you're traveling, which will not only help you avoid the potentially ache-inducing triggers, but also could also give you more energy so you don't feel sluggish before you board.
<br>
<li class="text-justify">AVOID DARK ALCOHOLS AND SUGARY DRINKS</li><br>
This one's a no-brainer: You already know to drink lots of water during flights to prevent dehydration. For the same reason, you should limit excessive amounts of coffee, alcoholic, and sugary drinks just before and during your flight. If you really need an adult beverage to calm your nerves, stick to clear liquors (like gin and vodka), which typically trigger less head discomfort than wine, beer, or fizzy cocktails. Why? Clear liquors contain fewer or no “congeners,” byproducts that form during fermentation that can be difficult for the body to break down. There is one exception to this rule, however: Some people find that caffeine helps ward off migraines, and so if you feel one coming on, a swig of coffee might help. (But still, keep chugging that water.)
<br>
<li class="text-justify">WARD OFF MOTION SICKNESS</li><br>
Turbulence can do more than mess with your nerves—it can also make you queasy, which can trigger a migraine. Keep motion sickness medication in your carry-on as well if you're sensitive to movement, and you might save yourself from a stomachache and headache.
<br>
<li class="text-justify">PACK YOUR SLEEP GEAR</li><br>
“Good sleep, possibly with the use of melatonin [if necessary], may be beneficial as alterations in sleep habit and jet lag can be migraine triggering, as well,” says Dr. Monteith. It certainly helps to get a proper rest the night before a flight, but for long hauls, it's just as important to sleep on the plane. Be sure, especially if you're flying a red-eye, to wear comfortable clothes and bring proper travel sleepwear—including an eye mask, ear plugs, and comfy socks—to have the best possible (and headache-free) trip.

</p>
<li class="text-justify">Pimples</li>
<p class="text-justify">The dry air on airplanes can irritate your skin, no matter what type you have. For those with already dry skin, the air on a plane can exacerbate the dryness, while those with oily skin could produce excess oils to compensate for the dryness.

Here is what you can do before, during, and after your travel to ensure your skin stays flawless when you fly.
<br>
<ol>Before:</ol> <p>Clean your skin and moisturize with a thick, non-fragranced cream. It is best to refrain from makeup on an airplane as to not clog your pores, but if you are going to wear makeup, use a non-comedogenic type.
<br>
<ol>During:</ol> <p>Avoid touching your face, as many people do when they rest their head on their hands while reading or watching a movie on the plane. You could transfer dirt and impurities onto your skin that will cause you to break out.
<br>
<ol>After:</ol> <p>Shortly after the flight, cleanse your skin so you can quickly wash away any impurities. Bring a travel size moisturizer that you can use when you land so you can get going and get glowing!
<br>
Aside from the air associated with traveling on planes, packing, going through TSA, and navigating the airport can be a stressful experience. Elevated stress levels can cause breakouts, so it is important to focus on alleviating your stress before, during, and after your travel.</p>

<li class="text-justify">Nausea and vomiting</li>
<p class="text-justify">Motion sickness in flight - otherwise known as airsickness - is a real problem for many people. The most common symptoms of this condition are nausea, stomach pain, vomiting and dizziness. This condition is caused by the movements and oscillations of the plane whilst it is in flight. Once the plane has taken off, the human eye notes the apparent lack of movement inside the cabin whilst the ear detects the oscillations of the aircraft. So the brain receives conflicting messages from its sensory apparatus and induces a feeling of loss of balance and general malaise. To help ease this disorder, there are a few methods that you can try out both before and during the flight.
 
Here are 5 simple things you can do to prevent and combat the symptoms of airsickness: 
 <br>
<ol>• Eat a light meal before boarding the plane:</ol><p> flying on an empty stomach, contrary to popular belief, does not help to avoid airsickness - in fact, it exacerbates it. We would therefore recommend having a few light snacks before the flight, such as fruit, vegetables or some crackers. It is a good idea to avoid coffee, alcohol, nicotine and fatty foods that could take a long time to digest, causing nausea.
 <br>
<ol>• Choose the right seat for you:</ol><p> pick a seat close to the window and try to focus on a point on the horizon to give your brain an external reference. If you are travelling after sunset, choose a seat in the middle of the plane where the movements and oscillations of the aircraft are less dramatic. Finally, ensure that you know where the airsickness bags are located, just in case you need them. With Air Dolomiti you can reserve your seat in advance!
 <br>
<ol>• Avoid reading or staring at the screen of an electronic device for a long time: </ol><p>just as with carsickness, concentrating on an object in your hands or inside the cabin contributes to a loss of orientation, causing nausea. Try to look out of the window and only concentrate on details in the cabin for short periods of time.
 <br>
<ol>• Chew some minty chewing gum and focus on your breathing:</ol><p> the action of chewing stimulates digestion and relaxation. Mint flavouring also has a soothing effect on the stomach, alleviating the sensation of nausea and indigestion. In the meantime, try to take slow, deep breaths to ease yourself to sleep.
 <br>
<ol>• Use anti-nausea drugs or natural remedies:</ol><p> there are various commonly-used, over-the-counter drugs for airsickness, including sedative antihistamines, which you should take half an hour before the flight, and the hyoscine patch, which you should place behind your ear. Remember to take note of any possible side effects, including dry mouth and blurred vision. There are also some very effective natural remedies for airsickness, such as ginger, which is widely believed to have an anti-nausea effect, or lemon, whose pungent flavour encourages the brain to pay more attention to the information coming from the body.
