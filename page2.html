<p class="text-justify">Diarrhea:</p>

 <p class="text-justify">
 Diarrhea occurs in a significant number of people who travel to foreign countries. Travelers to developing countries of the world become ill from eating or drinking food or water contaminated by infected human bowel waste.
Traveler's diarrhea can be defined as three or more unformed stools in a 24-hour period.
Who is at risk for traveler's diarrhea?
<br>
* People traveling from industrialized countries to developing countries.<br>
* Traveler's diarrhea is more common in young adults.<br>
* A large percentage of travelers to the high-risk areas will develop diarrhea.<br>
High-risk areas<br>
* Mexico<br>
* Latin America<br>
* Africa<br>
* Middle East<br>
* Asia<br>
Moderate-risk areas<br>
* Caribbean islands<br>
* Southern Europe<br>
* Israel<br>
Low-risk areas<br>
* United States<br>
* Canada<br>
* Northern Europe<br>
* New Zealand<br>
* Australia<br>
What Causes Traveler's Diarrhea?
A person can become infected by eating or drinking food or water that has come in contact with feces. Food and water become contaminated when they are handled by people with fecal content on their hands - not in direct contact with feces. Restaurants are common sites for exposure to this type of food poisoning. Food from street vendors is even more risky. Eating in a private home is the safest food source.
 
 </p>

<p class="text-justify">Management:</p> 
<ul class="text-justify"> 
<li class="text-justify"> stay hydrated with lots of water and electrolyte drinks.</li>
<li class="text-justify"> The presence of blood in diarrhea or high fevers can mean the infection is invasive and may require antibiotics </li>
<li class="text-justify">Don’t eat anything that is not properly and thoroughly cooked.</li>
<li class="text-justify">Avoid tap water, ice, and veggies washed in tap water. </li>
<li class="text-justify">If the restaurant or food stand looks dirty or the chef has a sore on his hand,don’t eat there!</li>

 </ul>

<p class="text-justify">Respiratory Infections Symptoms :</p> 
<ul class="text-justify"> 
<li class="text-justify">runny nose. </li>

 <p class="text-justify">
 This type of infectious illness are second only to diarrhoea as a cause of illness in travellers. Certain situations encountered when travelling place travellers at an increased risk of acquiring a respiratory infection.
Catching a cold at home is easy enough but travelling will increase your susceptibility and expose you to new germs to which you have no natural immunity.
Coughs, colds and sore throats are very common in travellers but can be easily treated using over the counter remedies which are available in pharmacies and drug stores world-wide. Antibiotics can be purchased over the counter in many countries but should be avoided in this instance since they are totally ineffective against cold viruses.
The majority of respiratory tract infections are viral and are therefore not susceptible to antibiotic treatment. When prescribed, antibiotics are often for secondary infections.
Many travellers spend long periods of time in crowded conditions such as airports, hotels etc. These places provide ideal conditions for spreading many acute respiratory infections like common colds and influenza.
Dry aircraft cabin atmospheres and smoking more than usual (even passively), exposure to new allergens, dust and city air pollution will all contribute to respiratory symptoms.
Meningococcal infections, although not themselves infections of the respiratory tract are also spread through the respiratory route and there have been outbreaks in tourist resorts. Vaccination should be considered for those at risk in endemic areas during outbreaks.
These infections are difficult to prevent because of the ease with which they are spread from person to person. Those liable to chest infections may benefit from taking an 'emergency' course of antibiotics with them.

<p class="text-justify">Management:</p> 
<ul class="text-justify">
<li class="text-justify">nasal decongestants ( pseudoephedrine ). </li>
<li class="text-justify">fever control ( acetaminophen or paracetamol ).</li>
 </ul>

  <br>

<p class="text-justify"> Bladder infection:</p> 
<ul class="text-justify"> 
<li class="text-justify"> Problems occur when the infection spreads to the kidneys.  </li>
<li class="text-justify"> The most common bacterial cause is E.Coli .  </li>
<li class="text-justify"> Most common in women travelers.</li>
 </ul>

<p class="text-justify">Management:</p> 
<ul class="text-justify"> 
<li class="text-justify">This requires serious help and antibiotics (ciprofloxacin.) </li>
<li class="text-justify">When using the toilet, women should wipe “front to back” to prevent bacteria from the back reaching the front.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <br>
 <p class="text-justify"> Skin problem</p> 
<p class="text-justify">
<p class="text-justify">Skin diseases are a common problem of travelers. One in 10 people are affected during travel; others may not notice symptoms until after they return--days, weeks, or even months later. Most skin problems are caused by insect bites, bacterial and fungal infections, allergic reactions, or too much exposure to sunshine and ultraviolet light.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">RISK FACTORS</p>
<li class="text-justify">Heat and Humidity</li>

 <p class="text-justify">The body sweats to stay cool. If the sweat ducts become blocked because of heat and humidity, they can cause prickly heat or become infected. Hot moist skin encourages bacterial and fungal growth.
</p>
<li class="text-justify">Insects</li>
 <p class="text-justify">Bites are common from insects such as mosquitoes, gnats, sandflies, ticks, and mites. These bites can cause allergic reactions and often become infected. Some insect bites can transmit infections. Other Some insects can transmit worms or larvae that can penetrate the skin.
</p>
<li class="text-justify">Sunlight and Ultraviolet Radiation </li>
<p class="text-justify">The ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight can cause sunburn, rashes, and eye irritation that could lead to blindness. Sunlight can cause allergic reactions when taking certain drugs, such as oral contraceptives or antibiotics; it can also cause a rash when it comes into contact with chemicals found in some sun lotions (such as lemon oil). Long-term exposure to sunlight can lead to skin cancer, premature aging, and chronic itching. Young children, blue-eyed blondes, and especially green-eyed red heads are at greater risk of sunburn and UV damage. UV radiation is greatest near the equator, at high altitudes, near reflecting surfaces such a snow, sand, or water, and when the sun is directly overhead. In addition, UV radiation can penetrate clear water to a depth of 3 feet, so it is possible to get a sunburn underwater.
</p>
<li class="text-justify">Preexisting Medical Conditions</li>
<p class="text-justify">Eczema can get worse in hot climates, and people who have a tendency toward eczema or asthma might experience their first episode since infancy. Psoriasis, by contrast, sometimes improves in sunlight. Persons with HIV infection are at risk of allergic skin reactions to medications such as those containing sulfa and some antibiotics.
Specific Activities or Places If traveling "rough," one can come into contact with lice and scabies. Rural travelers, persons on safari, and especially campers are at greatest risk of insect, tick, and mite bites. The seas also contain animals that can cause irritated skin or painful skin lesions (see Marine Envenomation). Some diseases are more common in certain areas of the world. Filarial infections (worms) are a risk if traveling to or living in tropical west or central Africa (see Filarial Infections).

<li>PREVENTION</li> 
<li>Care of the skin:</li> Try to adapt slowly to a tropical climate and stay as cool as possible. Keep skin cool and clean through frequent showering. In a humid climate, dry off thoroughly. In a dry climate, use a moisturizer. Clean cuts and scratches with an antiseptic wipe and cover until healed. Protect against UV radiation: Children and persons who do not tan easily should stay out of the sun as much as possible, especially in the middle of the day, wear long-sleeved clothes, and use a wide-brimmed hat or umbrella and wraparound UV protective sunglasses. Use sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or more and lip protection screen. Apply sunscreen before
Traveler Information

 exposure to the sun and reapply after swimming or heavy perspiration. Wear a shirt while swimming. <br><li>Avoid insect bites:</li> There are 3 main ways to avoid insect bites: Avoid risky areas at risky times. Use repellents on skin and garments. (See Insect Precautions.) Use insecticides on garments, mosquito nets, and inside camping tents. Discuss the itinerary with a travel health care provider to learn about possible areas of risk. Use an effective repellent in the daytime (especially early morning and late afternoon to dusk) and in the evening hours (dusk to dawn) to protect against species of insects that bite at different times of day. (Do not apply repellent to sunburnt or inflamed skin.) Do not use more than the manufacturer's recommended dosage when applying insect repellent on children. Use permethrin (an insecticide) on bed nets and curtains. Burning coils and knockdown insecticide sprays may also help prevent bites. In a hot climate, wash clothes frequently and iron to kill myiasis larvae. <br><li>Medications and first aid kit:</li>
 Those with a preexisting medical problem, should consult a doctor before travel and be sure to take an adequate supply of necessary medications, especially if those with severe allergies. <li>Travelers should carry a first aid kit, which at minimum should contain:</li> sunscreen of an appropriate SPF, DEET or other suitable insect repellent, 1% hydrocortisone ointment, antiseptic cream, antiseptic wipes, adhesive bandages, antifungal cream, and aspirin or acetaminophen tablets. If going on a long trip or to places with poor medical facilities, ask a doctor for an antibiotic suitable for cellulitis
